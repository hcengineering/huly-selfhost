### Overview

The new Mail Service, supporting both SMTP and Amazon SES, has been added. If your setup currently uses the `ses` service, you'll need to migrate to the `mail` service.

### Key Changes

- **Unified Mail Service**: The `mail` service can be configured to send emails via SMTP or Amazon SES, but not both simultaneously.
- **Migration Requirement**: Transitioning from the `ses` service to the `mail` service requires updating your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Migration Steps

1. **Update Configuration**: Replace the `ses` service with the `mail` service in your `docker-compose.yaml` file. Configure the environment variables to match your chosen email service (SMTP or SES).

2. **Rename Environment Variables**: If you're using SES, update your environment variables:
   - Change `ACCESS_KEY` to `SES_ACCESS_KEY`
   - Change `SECRET_KEY` to `SES_SECRET_KEY`
   - Change `REGION` to `SES_REGION`

3. **Integrate the Mail Service**: Use `MAIL_URL` instead of `SES_URL` in `transactor` and `account` containers:

    ```yaml
    account:
      ...
      environment:
        - MAIL_URL=http://mail:8097
      ...
    transactor:
      ...
      environment:
        - MAIL_URL=http://mail:8097
      ...
    ```
4. **Web Push Notifications**: Add `WEB_PUSH_URL` to `transactor` container if you want to use web push notifications:
    ```yaml
    transactor:
      ...
      environment:
        - MAIL_URL=http://mail:8097
        - WEB_PUSH_URL=http://ses:3335
      ...
    ```


## v0.6.466

No changes required.

## v0.6.429

No changes required.

## v0.6.424

Web-push keys have been moved from the `front` service to the `ses` service. If you are using the `ses` service, you will need to update the configuration:

```yaml
  front:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      # Remove the following lines
      # - PUSH_PUBLIC_KEY=your public key
      # - PUSH_PRIVATE_KEY=your private key
  ses:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      # Add the following lines
      - PUSH_PUBLIC_KEY=your public key
      - PUSH_PRIVATE_KEY=your private key
```

## v0.6.411

No changes required.

## v0.6.405

No changes required.

## v0.6.377

### Fulltext Service

Fulltext search functionality has been extracted into a separate `fulltext` service. This service is now required to be running in order to use the fulltext search functionality.

Configuration:

```yaml
  fulltext:
    image: hardcoreeng/fulltext:${HULY_VERSION}
    ports:
      - 4700:4700
    environment:
      - SERVER_SECRET=${HULY_SECRET}
      - DB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017
      - FULLTEXT_DB_URL=http://elastic:9200
      - ELASTIC_INDEX_NAME=huly_storage_index
      - STORAGE_CONFIG=minio|minio?accessKey=minioadmin&secretKey=minioadmin
      - REKONI_URL=http://rekoni:4004
      - ACCOUNTS_URL=http://account:3000
      - STATS_URL=http://stats:4900
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Update the `transactor` service to use the new `fulltext` service:

```yaml
  transactor:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      - FULLTEXT_URL=http://fulltext:4700
      # Remove the following lines
      # - ELASTIC_URL=http://elastic:9200
      # - ELASTIC_INDEX_NAME=huly_storage_index
      # - REKONI_URL=http://rekoni:4004
```

### Statistics Service

New statistics service has been added. The serivce is responsible for collecting and storing statistics about the usage of the application.

Configuration:

```yaml
  stats:
    image: hardcoreeng/stats:${HULY_VERSION}
    ports:
      - 4900:4900
    environment:
      - PORT=4900
      - SERVER_SECRET=${HULY_SECRET}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Other Huly services have been updated to use the new statistics service:

```yaml
  ...
    environment:
      - STATS_URL=http://stats:4900
      ...
```
