# Huly Migration

This document describes the changes required to update Huly from one version to another. Most of updates require updating Docker containers versions.
Though, some updates may require updating other configuration options. In this case, you should review the updated configuration options and update them accordingly.

## v0.6.424

Web-push keys have been moved from the `front` service to the `ses` service. If you are using the `ses` service, you will need to update the configuration:

```yaml
  front:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      # Remove the following lines
      # - PUSH_PUBLIC_KEY=your public key
      # - PUSH_PRIVATE_KEY=your private key
  ses:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      # Add the following lines
      - PUSH_PUBLIC_KEY=your public key
      - PUSH_PRIVATE_KEY=your private key
```

## v0.6.411

No changes required.

## v0.6.405

No changes required.

## v0.6.377

### Fulltext Service

Fulltext search functionality has been extracted into a separate `fulltext` service. This service is now required to be running in order to use the fulltext search functionality.

Configuration:

```yaml
  fulltext:
    image: hardcoreeng/fulltext:${HULY_VERSION}
    ports:
      - 4700:4700
    environment:
      - SERVER_SECRET=${HULY_SECRET}
      - DB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017
      - FULLTEXT_DB_URL=http://elastic:9200
      - ELASTIC_INDEX_NAME=huly_storage_index
      - STORAGE_CONFIG=minio|minio?accessKey=minioadmin&secretKey=minioadmin
      - REKONI_URL=http://rekoni:4004
      - ACCOUNTS_URL=http://account:3000
      - STATS_URL=http://stats:4900
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Update the `transactor` service to use the new `fulltext` service:

```yaml
  transactor:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      - FULLTEXT_URL=http://fulltext:4700
      # Remove the following lines
      # - ELASTIC_URL=http://elastic:9200
      # - ELASTIC_INDEX_NAME=huly_storage_index
      # - REKONI_URL=http://rekoni:4004
```

### Statistics Service

New statistics service has been added. The serivce is responsible for collecting and storing statistics about the usage of the application.

Configuration:

```yaml
  stats:
    image: hardcoreeng/stats:${HULY_VERSION}
    ports:
      - 4900:4900
    environment:
      - PORT=4900
      - SERVER_SECRET=${HULY_SECRET}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Other Huly services have been updated to use the new statistics service:

```yaml
  ...
    environment:
      - STATS_URL=http://stats:4900
      ...
```
