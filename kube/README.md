# Huly Kubernetes Deployment Guide

This repository contains Kubernetes manifests and configuration templates to deploy **Huly** on a working Kubernetes cluster.

---

## üß© Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have a **functioning Kubernetes cluster** (v1.26+ recommended) with sufficient resources for stateful and stateless workloads.

### 1. CockroachDB (version: `latest-v24.2`)

Huly requires a **CockroachDB** database.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Newer versions of CockroachDB (v25.x and above) are **not compatible** due to a known issue tracked here:  
> [hcengineering/platform#9963](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/issues/9963)

Only **CockroachDB** is currently supported.  
Alternatives such as **PostgreSQL** and **YugabyteDB** are **not** supported ‚Äî see the open issue for details:  
[hcengineering/platform#9831](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/issues/9831)

Deploy CockroachDB using your preferred operator or Helm chart, and ensure connectivity from the namespace.

### 2. Redpanda

Huly uses **Redpanda** as the Kafka-compatible streaming backbone.

We recommend installing the **Redpanda Operator** and deploying a cluster within the same namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha2
kind: Redpanda
metadata:
  name: redpanda
spec:
  clusterSpec:
    image:
      tag: v25.2.5
    statefulset:
      replicas: 3
    tls:
      enabled: false
```

This setup provides a minimal, non-TLS development cluster suitable for local and test environments.

### 3. Elasticsearch / OpenSearch

Huly requires an **Elasticsearch**-compatible search backend.

If you choose **OpenSearch**, note that:
- You must **disable security completely**, or
- Provide a **CA trusted by pod root**, or
- Place the service **behind a proxy** that translates plain HTTP to TLS.

> An issue is open to support `verify=false` for insecure configurations [hcengineering/platform#9974](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/issues/9974)

### 4. MinIO (S3-Compatible Storage)

Configure **MinIO** or any other S3-compatible service for storage (attachments, media, etc.).

You must define the endpoint and credentials in your deployment environment ‚Äî these values are provided via the `Secret` and `ConfigMap` manifests (see below).


## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Overview

Each microservice is deployed within the namespace as its own Deployment and Service pair (except for the workspace, which does not require a service).

These services are organized and managed through the top-level Kustomization file (kustomization.yaml) for convenience and familiarity. Alternatively, you can clone these files, update the corresponding ConfigMap and Secret files, and apply them as standard manifests to set up a functional cluster.

If email functionality is not required, ensure the MAIL_URL environment variable is set to an empty string ("") in both the account and transactor deployments otherwise login will require email verification.

## üåê Example HTTP Route (Gateway API)

Below is an example **HTTPRoute** definition for exposing Huly via `huly.example.com`.  
This configuration enforces HTTPS and routes internal service paths appropriately.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: huly.example.com
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: wan
  hostnames:
    - "huly.example.com"
  rules:
    # Force HTTPS
    - matches:
      - headers:
        - name: "x-forwarded-proto"
